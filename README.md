# AISDI - Algorithms and Data Structures
## About The Project
This repository consists of analysis of algorithms and data structures such as sorting, dictionaries, pattern searching and pathfinding.

For every problem I implement one or more algorithms and compare its efficency with their equivalence in [STL library](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library).

## Algorithms:
1. [Sorting]()
2. [Dictionaries]()

<!-- Sorting -->
